Security and performance

what is encryption and hashing or difference between on them

Hashing is a one-way process of coverting data into a fixed length string of characters,
where the output caannot be reversed back to the orginal output
bcrypt is hashing mechanism 
we use bycrypt and we hash the value using slated and stored it
when we compare password it compares hashing code not original one
In hashing we can't reverse it I mean to the original
Only the way is if known the only excat function

Algorithms : SHA-256 or bcrypt


encryption
public and private keys

encryption is a process of converting data into a secret code
so that it can only be read by authorized parties who have the decryption key

ssh is a encryption mechanism (using mechanism)

encryption is reversable

Algorithms : AES or RSA


Common security risks
Injection attacks, such as SQL injection and command injection
Cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks
Insecure authentication and authorization mechanisms
Cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attacks
Insecure handling of sensitive data, such as passwords and API keys
Vulnerable third-party dependencies and packages

SQL/Command Injection Attack

Helemt, xss are the for cleaning the paramters





npm audit to check Vulnerablility



//scenerio
otp based login
what are the Vulnerablility
1) otp expires 
2) request otp from one device and it shouldn't login on other device with same output
3) store logitude and lattitude


what is modilo(hash function)
what is domino impact
what is rate limiting

what is dedos(attacks)
what is log4 and tar(zip and unzip)
